Write a phython class which implements methods that perform acts in Redis for the following problem: 
Taxi
It stores only the present. The past is not important.

/1. store new car and driver (license_plate, driver name, number_of_transportable_passengers, production_year_of_car, cartype, phone_number)
/2. the car and the driver begin to work (from_date_time)
/3. the car and the driver finish the work (to_date_time) (writes information to RDBMS or JSON and deletes data)
/4. list of working cars
/5. route order  (address_from, address_to, date_time_from,  number_of_passengers) (id is a good idea)
/6. assign driver and car to a route
/7. fulfill a route, record the price and distance, date_time_to (it may store information in a RDBMS or in document database in JSON)
/8. list of cars and drivers with from_date_time of the work and period of that work. The list should be descending sorted by the period of the work.
/9. list of cars and drivers sorted by the sum of distances
/10. details of car and driver
/11. list of the ordered and not assigned routes
12. list of the working car ascending sorted by the sum of the prices of the work from its beginning. 
/13. list of cars
/14. list of the assigned and not fullfilled routes
/15. details of a route

I need a class, which implements these methods and a running code which teszt the class methods.
